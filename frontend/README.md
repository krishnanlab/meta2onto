# frontend

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.20. [Bun](https://bun.com)
is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

# Notes for Rescaffolding (remove after doing so)

You can re-run `bun init` in this folder to regenerate the project scaffolding
with, e.g., a different framework or bundler. The existing `Dockerfile` and
other supporting files should work with whatever new scaffolding you generate.
